  abstract = {Multivariate count data are commonly encountered through high-throughput sequencing technologies in bioinformatics, text mining, or sports analytics. Although the Poisson distribution seems a natural fit to these count data, its multivariate extension is computationally expensive. In most cases, mutual independence among the variables is assumed; however, this fails to take into account the correlation among the variables usually observed in the data. Recently, mixtures of multivariate Poisson-lognormal (MPLN) models have been used to analyze such multivariate count measurements with a dependence structure. In the MPLN model, each count is modeled using an independent Poisson distribution conditional on a latent multivariate Gaussian variable. Owing to this hierarchical structure, the MPLN model can account for over-dispersion as opposed to the traditional Poisson distribution and allows for correlation between the variables. Rather than relying on a Monte Carlo-based estimation framework, which is computationally inefficient, a fast variational expectationâ€“maximization (EM)-based framework is used here for parameter estimation. Further, a family of parsimonious mixtures of Poisson-lognormal distributions is proposed by decomposing the covariance matrix and imposing constraints on these decompositions. Utility of such models is shown using simulated and benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Abstract Proteomics data are often plagued with missingness issues. These missing values (MVs) threaten the integrity of subsequent statistical analyses by reduction of statistical power, introduction of bias, and failure to represent the true sample. Over the years, several categories of missing value imputation (MVI) methods have been developed and adapted for proteomics data. These MVI methods perform their tasks based on different prior assumptions (e.g., data is normally or independently distributed) and operating principles (e.g., the algorithm is built to address random missingness only), resulting in varying levels of performance even when dealing with the same dataset. Thus, to achieve a satisfactory outcome, a suitable MVI method must be selected. To guide decision making on suitable MVI method, we provide a decision chart which facilitates strategic considerations on datasets presenting different characteristics. We also bring attention to other issues that can impact proper MVI such as the presence of confounders (e.g., batch effects) which can influence MVI performance. Thus, these too, should be considered during or before MVI.},
